		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jesus Vicente "JV" Roig is the first ever <i> summa cum laude </i> of Asia Pacific College. During his May 2006 graduation JV
		also received the <i> Internship Award </i> and <i>Outstanding Project Award</i> for his internship stint at Don Bosco College, Canlubang
		which resulted in a Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP-based ERP system for schools which he christened "SYNERGY". 

        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JV likewise graduated top of his class in his post-grad studies (Master in Information Management), also at Asia Pacific College. Some of his friends
        jokingly refer to him now as <i>"Double"</i> - short for  <i>"Double summa cum laude"</i>.

        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from his CS and IT interests, JV is also currently spending some time in Robert E. Howard's Hyboria, courtesy of Age of Conan (EU, Crom Server). 
        He is usually logged on as "jvroig", an Aquilonian Guardian. Feel free to say hi in-game, he is usually very friendly and chatty. Cobalt discussions are welcome,
        but questing is preferred during game time. :)
